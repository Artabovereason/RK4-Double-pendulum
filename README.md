It is a rigid pendulum at the end of which another rigid pendulum is attached. The two inextensible rods of lengths <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=L_1"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=L_2"> have zero mass. The 2 masses at the ends are of masses <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=M_1"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=M_2">, which will be considered as punctual. The double pendulum is therefore fixed in O and articulated freely in <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=M_1">. The movement takes place in a plane of horizontal <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x"> and vertical <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y"> coordinates. We will consider that the two stems can “cross” without problem. The angle that the pendulum 1 makes with the vertical is denoted θ1 and the angle that the pendulum 2 makes with the vertical is denoted θ2. These angles are noted positively counterclockwise.
